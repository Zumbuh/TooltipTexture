# TooltipTexture

This mod makes it possible to modify the tooltip background using resource packs
(means it replaces the default background with a texture).

For resourcepack makers:  
The background texture used is located at 
`assets/tooltiptexture/background.png`,
the textures for the inner borders are at 
`assets/tooltiptexture/border_{top, bottom, left, right}.png`. The
textures for the outer borders are at
`assets/tooltiptexture/border_outer_{top, bottom, left, right}.png` respectively.
